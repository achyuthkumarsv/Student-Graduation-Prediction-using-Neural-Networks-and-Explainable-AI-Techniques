# Student-Graduation-Prediction-using-Neural-Networks-and-Explainable-AI-Techniques
This project predicts student graduation using static (e.g., demographics) and sequential (e.g., course/teacher) data. It involves EDA, neural network modeling, and SHAP for explainability to identify key factors impacting graduation outcomes.
